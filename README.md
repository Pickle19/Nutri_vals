# Nutri_vals

A project of mine, which main reason is to practice GA-s in a useful context, and to practice python and pandas.

The main idea is to use GA to determine an optimal list for grocery shopping, considering the price 
and the macronutrient you are interested in, in my specific case the protein content / 100g

The foods that are in the food.csv are items which I frequently buy.


TO DO list for later on:
 - Rewrite the fitness function in a way, which might be able to use
multiple macronutrient and/or calorie
 - Maybe adding more factors to the database, type of foods for example, like meat or vegetable
 - Adding the option to set a minimum ratio of meat, vegetable or any other type to appear in the solution
